# Parallel Programming Course

The following parallel programming technologies are considered in practice:
  * `MPI`
  * `OpenMP`
  * `TBB`

### Code style analysis

### Parallel programming technologies
### `MPI`
  * **Windows (`MSVC`)**:
  * Rectangular method: In mathematics, the midpoint rule, also known as the midpoint Riemann sum or midpoint method, is a method of estimating the integral of a function or the area under a curve by dividing the area into rectangles of equal width.

### `OpenMP`
  
  * `OpenMP` is included into `gcc` and `msvc`, but some components should be installed additionally
  * Digital image enhancement: This tool is designed to enhance images by adjusting contrast through the utilization of the histogram equalization algorithm. This algorithm employs a cumulative intensity histogram to map the original image's intensities, resulting in an image with equalized intensity levels.

### `TBB`
  * **Windows (`MSVC`)**: 
  * Shell sort batcher: Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.
